## Project Description

We're building **BrokeEats**, a budget-focused restaurant review API tailored for (broke) college kids. The goal is to source reviews and ratings for local eateries that deliver high value for low cost. Users can submit short reviews, rate price-to-value ratios, and tag food spots based on affordability and portion size. This API will help college students discover the best bang-for-your-buck spots in their area without breaking the bank.
